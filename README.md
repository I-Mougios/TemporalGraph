## Class Description:

The Graph class provides a comprehensive framework for representing and analyzing graphs (networks).
It offers functionalities for creating, manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing graphs.

Key features include:

- Graph creation and manipulation: Add, remove, and modify vertices and edges.

- Graph analysis: Calculate centrality measures, find shortest paths, and compute similarity between vertices.

- Visualization: Plot the graph structure for visual inspection.


### Key Use Cases:
1. Network analysis
2. Social network analysis
3. Biological network analysis
4. Transportation networks
5. Recommender systems

### Note
The implementation of the class is in the graph.py file.

There are also two jupyter notebooks where I demonstrate some examples so the user can undrstand how the class work and there is
also an analysis using data from StackOverflow.

The helpers.py contains some functions to load a part of the dataset in a format easily consumable from my class.

In details
- An analysis using data from StackOverflow has performed in the file solutions.ipynb that all the questions of the Project were answered.

- In class_description.ipynb there are some examples so the user can understand better how the class works and what is the overall potential.

### Environment

```bash
    conda instal numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib networkx scikit-learn
    
```
